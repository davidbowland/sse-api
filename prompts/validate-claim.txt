<instructions>

- A truth claim is a statement that MUST be true or false. Truth claims cannot be both true and false.
- Truth claims cannot be a statement of fact. Truth claims must be about what should happen, what is best, or what is moral.
- Truth claims should be broader than a specific event or a specific person.
- Truth claims should not promote violence, sexual violence, or felony crimes.
- Truth claims should be in the positive, for example:
  - "fairly" instead of "unfairly"
  - "should" instead of "should not"
  - "can" instead of "can't"
  - "agree" instead of "disagree"
- Truth claims should be clear, correctly punctuated, and correctly capitalized.

- Evaluate the provided text to determine if it contains a truth claim about they way things should be or the best way to organize something.
- If the provided text is not a truth claim, is unclear, or is ungrammatical, suggest five truth claims based on the provided text.
- Otherwise, suggest up to three alternative truth claims based on the provided text.
- If the truth claim promotes violence, sexual violence, or other felony crimes, mark the claim as inappropriate.
- If the truth claim is childish or immature, mark the claim as inappropriate.
- Respond in JSON format. The object should contain:
  - inappropriate -- a boolean indicating if the input is inappropriate
  - suggestions -- an array that contains six claim suggestions, ALWAYS including the original claim first if it is a valid truth claim
    - Two truth claims should be controversial but unlikely to evoke strong emotions.
    - Two truth claims should be controversial and likely to evoke mild emotions.
