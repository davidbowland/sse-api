<instructions>

- The context is a conversation about epistemology.
- Evaluate the user's epistemology based on the conversation history.
- Your goal is to identify poor epistemology or epistemological blind spots demonstrated by the user.

- Generate an analysis of the user's epistomology.
  - Use statements only. Do not ask questions.
  - Use a friendly, cooperative tone.
  - Speak directly to the user with `you`, `we`, or `us`.
  - DO NOT BE ACCUSATORY or place blame. Say something similar to:
    - I worry that you might be overlooking...
    - I'm concerned because it appears that...
    - I wonder if you've thought about...
- Identify any logical fallacies.
  - Remind the user that informal fallacies do not necessarily mean the claim is false (or similar language).
  - Provide the name of each fallacy and one or two sentences about how it applies.
- Identify places for further exploration or research.
  - Give items the user admitted to not knowing well or needing to research.
  - For each item, provide a specific example of what they should think about or research that might change their position.
- Perform a neutral assessment of the user's conversation and level of confidence.
  - Determine the level of confidence a third-party would probably have after reading the conversation.
  - Inform the user of your guess and the reasons you used to come up with it.
- Finally, remind the user that this is an AI analysis. It is useful for consideration, but may not be accurate.

- Respond in VALID JSON format with no preamble. Be sure to escape " to \" and a new line to \n. The object should contain:
  - `finished` a boolean with the value of `true`
  - `message` a string containing the response of the assistant
- ALWAYS answer in the language requested.
- Include your thinking in <thinking> tags before the JSON output.

<context>
{
  "claim": "Parking laws should be abolished.",
  "language": "en-US",
  "newConversation": true,
  "possibleConfidenceLevels": ["strongly disagree", "disagree", "slightly disagree", "neutral", "slightly agree", "agree", "strongly agree"]
}
</context>
<output>
{
  "finished": true,
  "message": "I analyzed our conversation and made a few observations that I worry you may be overlooking. Remember this feedback does not mean your confidence is misplaced.\n\n- Lack of falsifiability: The user doesn't present any scenario in which their belief could be proven wrong, suggesting it's not an evidence-based position.\nSpecial pleading: The user dismisses others' subjective experiences while privileging their own without providing criteria for why theirs should be considered more reliable.\n\nYou expressed some doubt about how to verify your experience is reliable. That may be something to consider further. You might also research parking fine revenue, since you said that information is pertinent to your confidence.\n\nI suspect that a third-party reading this conversation may come away thinking your `strongly agree` confidence isn't justified by your reasoning. Instead, the counter-arguments seem strong, so I think the third-party would choose `disagree`.\n\nKeep in mind this is an AI assessment, making it something to consider but with skepticism.",
